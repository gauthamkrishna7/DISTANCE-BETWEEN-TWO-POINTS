# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
a = [4,2]
b = [10,6]
d = math.sqrt((b[0] - a[0])**2 + (b[1] - a[1])**2)
print(round(d,2))
```
